Hi! I am a final-year undergraduate student at [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in **Electrical and Computer Engineering**, minoring in **Data Science**. Currently, I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Ruihao Zhu](https://rzhu.github.io/) at [Cornell SC Johnson College of Business](https://business.cornell.edu/?_gl=1%2Am9kg4r%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_ga%2AMTcwNjA0MzE4Ni4xNzI5OTA3NjQ3%2A_ga_PJ9SLZ1H8W%2AMTcyOTkwNzY0Ny4xLjAuMTcyOTkwNzY0Ny4wLjAuMA..) and [Prof. Cheng Hua](https://acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/faculty/huacheng.html) at [ACEM, Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://acem.sjtu.edu.cn/acem2021/en/). I used to exchange in [ORIE, Cornell](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie).

Research Interest
